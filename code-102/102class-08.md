### Quiz
1. What is an expression in JavaScript?
Answer: any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value.

2. Why would we use a loop in our code?
Answer: When programmers write code, loops allow them to shorten what could be hundreds of lines of code to just a few. This allows them to write the code once and repeat it as many times as needed, making it more likely for the program to run as expected.

3. When does a for loop stop executing?
Answer: When the end of the range is reached, the for loop will exit.
4. How many times will a while loop execute?
Answer: loop repeats as long as the condition is true (non-zero). If the condition is false the body of the loop never executes at all.
