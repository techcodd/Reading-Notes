Introduction

Hey everyone. My name is Natalia. I like learning to code, but I am still trying to figure out. Hopefully eventually I will get there.

I like also learning new foreign languages, and travelling, cooking, tennis, yoga, meditation. I love animals. Especially parrots))

Healthy habits on learning to code, I think it will be:

.Train 
.Do home work
.Getting enough sleep
.Eat healthy
.Excercise
